# Troubleshooting

Most of you are familiar with the term troubleshooting. It essentially means to idenitifying a problem, learning more about what may be causing the problem and eventually coming with a plan that will resolve the problem. When it comes to databases, usually you are troubleshooting scalability and performance related issues. Database troubleshooting is a very broad topic but we are hoping to introduce the concept to you so that you can continue to look into further on your own.

## Monitoring

Monitoring the performance of your database is a best way to identify if there are issues that we need to troubleshoot. There are a few tools that come with PostgreSQL for this purpose.

## Database Design

Database normalization is the process of making sure the database adheres to the normal forms. In certain situations, denormalizing a database will actually speed up the performance of the database. Part of the database design process is trying to find a balance between normalizing the database and providing high performance.

## Query Optimization

The process of identifying the queries and/or stored procedures that are slow and refactoring those queries to enhance performance.

## Indexing

By indexing the data that is most often retrieved, we can speed up the data retrieval process, making our database more efficient.
