# Creating Carnival Reports

As Carnival grows, we have been asked to help solve two issues:

1. It has become more and more difficult for the accounting department to keep track of the all the records in the sales table and how much money came in from each sale. 

1. HR currently has a overflowing filing cabinet with files on each employee, with a list of dealerships they have previous worked at and the dealerships they currently work at. All the files on previous employees are in a pile next to the cabinet.

## Goal
- Provide a way for the accounting team
